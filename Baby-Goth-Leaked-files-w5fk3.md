Baby Goth was born on a nice day in London, which she believes played a role in shaping her name and her art. She grew up in a creative family, with both parents being artists. Baby Goth's early years were filled with art supplies and museum visits, which ignited her passion for creating. She pursued her education in art, earning a Bachelor's degree from the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art in London. Baby Goth has been open about her struggles with depression and anxiety, but her online presence has also attracted toxicity and online harassment. Critics argue that her content perpetuates harmful stereotypes and objectifies women. Some fans, meanwhile, defend her right to express herself and criticize the double standards surrounding female sexuality.
